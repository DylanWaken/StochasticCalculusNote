### Properties of Topology

If $X$ is a set, a collection of subsets of $X$, $\mathcal{T}$ is called a topology if it satisfies

- 1: $X$ and $\varnothing$ are elements of $\mathcal{T}$ .
- 2: $\mathcal{T}$ is **closed under finite intersections**: if $U_{1},\dots,U_{n}$ are elements of $\mathcal{T}$, then their intersection  $\bigcap_{n} U_{i}$ is an element of T .
- 3: $\mathcal{T}$ is **closed under arbitrary union:** if $(U_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}$ is any (finite or infinite) family of elements of $\mathcal{T}$ , then their union $\bigcap_{\alpha \in A} U_{\alpha}$ is an element of $\mathcal{T}$ .

The pair of $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is called a **Topological Space**. The individual elements of $X$ is called **points**, and all elements of $\mathcal{T}$ is called **Open Sets**. The last 2 properties of topological spaces can be rephrased as:

- Any intersection of finitely many open subsets of $X$ is an open subset of $X$ .
- Any union of arbitrarily many open subsets of $X$ is an open subset of $X$ .

If $p \in X$, the **neighborhood** of $p$ is a open subset $p\in N, N \in \mathcal{T}, N \subseteq X$
If $K \subseteq X$, the **neighborhood** of $K$ is a open subset $K \subseteq N, N \in \mathcal{T}, N \subseteq X$

**trivial topology i**s defined as  $\mathcal{T} = \{\varnothing ,X\}$ - smallest topology
**discrete topology** is defined as  $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{P}(X)$ - largest topology (covers all possible subsets of $X$), and $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is thus called a discrete space.

If there exists metric such that $(X,d)$ is a metric space, a topology is generated by $d$ (since "distance" and "<" would defined open sets), which is called **Metric Induced Topology**, and $X$ is said to be **metrizable**

### Closed Sets

**A closed set is a set that contains all of its limit points.**

Suppose $X$ is a topological space and $A$ is any subset of $X$. The following relationships are defined:
$$\bar{A} = \bigcap\{ B\subseteq X: A \subseteq B, B\notin \mathcal{T} \}$$
- The **closure** of a set $A$ in $X$ is the intersection of all closed sets in $X$ that contains $A$, or it is the smallest closed set containing $A$

The **interior** of $A$ is denoted by $IntA$ as: $$Int A = \bigcup\{ C \subseteq X : C\subseteq A, C\in \mathcal{T} \}$$
- The **interior** of a set $A$ in $X$ is the union of all open sets in $X$ that are contained in $A$. or it is the largest open set contained by $A$

The **Exterior** of $A$ is denoted by $Ext A$ as: $$ExtA = X \setminus \bar{A}$$
The **Boundary** of $A$ is denoted by $\partial A$, as:$$\partial A = X\setminus (Int A \cup Ext A)=\bar{A} \setminus Int A $$
A **Limit Point** or **Accumulation Point** $p$ of $A$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point of $A$ other than $p$ (which itself might or might not be in A). 

A point $p \in A$  is called an **isolated point** of $A$ if $p$ has a neighborhood $U$ in $X$ such that $U\cap A = \{ p \}$ 

Every point of $A$ is either a limit point or an isolated point, but not both.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be dense in $X$ if $\bar{A} = X$.

### Convergence and Continuity

If $X$ is a topological space, $\{ x \}_{i=1}^n \in X$ is a sequence of points. with another point $x\in X$we say that **the sequence converges to $x$**, **and $x$ is the limit of the sequence,** if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{i} \in U$ for all $i>N$ Symbolically, this is denoted by either $x_i \to x$ or $\lim_{ i \to \infty } x_{i} = x$

**Continuous maps between topological spaces:** If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, a map $f:X\to Y$ is said to be **continuous** if for every open subset $U \subseteq Y$ the preimage $f^{-1}(U)\in \mathcal{T}_{X}$, or the preimage is open in $X$

A map between topological spaces is continuous if and only if the preimage of every open subset is open

The converse is also true, A map between topological spaces is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed subset is closed

> **Properties of Continuous Maps:**
> (a) Every constant map $f:X\to Y$ is continuous 
> (b) The identity map $Id_{X}:X\to X$ is continuous
> (c) if $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, so is the restriction of $f$ to any open subset of $X$.
> (d) if $f : X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are both continuous, then so is their composition $g \circ f$

**Local Criterion for Continuity:** A map $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is continuous if and only if each point of $X$ has a neighborhood on which (the restriction of ) $f$ is continuous.

If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, a **homeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$** is a bijective map $\psi : X\to Y$ such that both $\psi$ and $\psi^{-1}$ are continuous. If there exists such map between spaces $X$ and $Y$, then $X,Y$ are said to be topological equivalent.

NOTE that a single direction map between topological spaces that are both continuous and bijective does not mean its inverse is continuous. For example, the map from an open 1d interval to a closed circle.

Given 2 topologies on set $X$ as $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{2}$, we say that **$\mathcal{T}_{1}$is finer than $\mathcal{T}_{2}$** if $\mathcal{T}_{1} \supseteq \mathcal{T}_{2}$. We say that **$\mathcal{T}_{1}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}_{2}$** if $\mathcal{T}_{1} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{2}$. 

A map $f:X\to Y$ (continuous or not) is said to be an **open map** if it takes **open subsets of $X$ to open subset of $Y$.**  ($\forall U\subseteq X, U \in \mathcal{T}_{X},f(U)\in\mathcal{T}_{Y}$). It is said to be a **closed map** if it takes **closed subsets of $X$ to closed subsets of $Y$**. ($\forall U\subseteq X, U \notin \mathcal{T}_{X}, f(U) \notin \mathcal{T}_{Y}$).

A homeomorphism map is both open and closed.

> **Properties of arbitrary maps between topological spaces:** Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, and $f : X \to Y$ is any map.
> (a) $f$ is continuous if and only if $f(\bar{A}) \subseteq \overline{f(A)}$ for all $A \subseteq X$
> (b) $f$ is closed if and only if $f(\bar{A}) \supseteq \overline{f(A)}$ for all $A \subseteq X$
> (c) $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1} (IntB)\subseteq Int f^{-1}(B)$ for all $B \subseteq Y$ .
> (d ) $f$ is closed if and only if $f^{-1} (IntB)\supseteq Int f^{-1}(B)$ for all $B \subseteq Y$ .

We say that a map $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is a **local homeomorphism** if every point $x \in X$ has a neighborhood $U \subseteq X$ such that $f(U)$ is an open subset of $Y$ and $f|_{U} : U\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism.

> **Properties of Local Homeomorphisms**
> (a) Every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism.
> (b) Every local homeomorphism is continuous and open
>  (c) Every bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism

Note that:
$$A \subseteq B \implies f(A) \subseteq f(B), \forall f $$

### Hausdorff Spaces

A topological space $X$ is said to be a **Hausdorff space** if given any pairf(\overline{f^{-1}(B)}) of distinct points $p_{1},p_{2} \in X$ here exist neighborhoods $U_{1}$ of $p_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ of $p_{2}$ with $U_{1} \cap U_{2} = \varnothing$ . This property is often summarized by saying **“points can be separated by open subsets**.”

- Every metric space is Hausdorff (disjoint by the triangle inequality)

- Every discrete space is Hausdorff, since $\{ p_{1} \}$ and $\{ p_{2} \}$ are themselves disjoint open subsets.

- Every open subset of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff: if $V \subseteq X$ is open in the Hausdorff space $X$, and $p_{1},p_{2}$ are distinct points of $V$, then in $X$ there are open subsets $U_{1},U_{2}$ separating $p_{1},p_{2}$ with the sets $U_{1} \cap V$ and $U_{2} \cap V$ open in $V$. disjoint, and contain $p_{1},p_{2}$ respectively.

- Every point in continuous space is closed

> Let $X$ be a Hasdroff space:
>
(a) Every finite subset (finite unions of one-point sets) of $X$ is closed
(b) If a sequence $(p_{i})$ in $X$ converges to a limit $p \in X$, the limit is unique.
(c) Suppose $X$ is a Hausdorff space and $A \subseteq X$. If $p \in X$ is a limit point of $A$, then every neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many points of $A$

$X$ is a Hausdorff space, $U \cap (A\setminus p) \neq \varnothing$

### Basis

Let X be a topological space. A collection $\mathbf{B}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a **basis for the topology of** $X$ if the following two conditions hold:

(i) Every element of $\mathbf{B}$ is a open subset of $X$ 
(ii) Every open subset of $X$ is the union of some collection of elements of $\mathbf{B}$

Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $\mathbf{B}$ be a basis for $Y$. A map $f:X\to Y$ is continuous map if and only if for every basis subset $b\in \mathbf{B}$. 

Let $X$ be a set, and suppose $\mathbf{B}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, then $\mathbf{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ if and only if it satisfies the following two conditions: 

1) $\bigcup _{B\in\mathbf{B}} B = Z$
2) If $B_{1},B_{2} \in \mathbf{B}$ and $x \in B_{1} \cap B_{2}$ , there exists an element $B_{3} \in \mathbf{B}$  such that $x \in B_{3} \subseteq B_{1} \cap B_{2}$

If so, there is a unique topology on $X$ for which $\mathbf{B}$ is a basis, called the topology generated by $\mathbf{B}$.

### First Countable

If $X$ is a topological space and $p \in X$, a collection $\mathbf{B}_{p}$ of neighborhoods of $p$ is called a **neighborhood basis for $X$ at $p$** if every neighborhood of $p$ contains some $B \in \mathbf{B}_{p}$. We say that $X$ is **first countable** if there exists a countable neighborhood basis at each point.

Example, in Metric space, the set of open balls around any point forms a neighborhood basis, and that set is countable due to countability of rational numbers, and thus metric space topology is first countable.

>**Nested Neighborhood Basis Lemma:**
Let $X$ be a first countable space. For every $p \in X$, there exists a nested neighborhood basis at $p$.
>  If there is a finite neighborhood basis $\{ V_{1},\dots,V_{k} \}$ at $p$. we can always generate another set $U = V_{1}\cap \dots \cap V_{k}$. Otherwise, there is a countably infinite neighborhood basis, which we may write as $\{ V_{i} \}_{i=1}^\infty$.

>**Sequence Lemma:**
Suppose $X$ is a first countable space, $A$ is any subset of $X$ , and $x$ is any point of $X$
>
a) $x \in \bar{A}$ if and only if $x$ is a limit of a sequence of points in $A$
b) $x \in IntA$ if and only if every sequence in $X$ converging to $x$ is eventually in $A$.
c) $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A$ contains every limit of every convergent sequence of points in $A$.
d) $A$ is open in $X$ if and only if every sequence in $X$ converging to a point of $A$ is eventually in $A$.

### Second Countable

If $X$ is any topological space, a collection $U$ of subsets of $X$ is said to be a **cover** of $X$ ,or to **cover** $X$ , if every point of $X$ is in at least one of the sets of $U$. It is called an **open cover** if each of the sets in $U$ is open, and a **closed cover** if each set is closed.

space $X$ is said to be **second countable** if every open subset of $X$ can be written as the union of some countable set of basis open sets, or we say $X$ have a countable basis. Properties :

> (a) $X$ is first countable
(b) $X$ contains a countable dense subset 
(c) Every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover

A topological space $X$ is said to be **separable** if it contains a countable dense subset. 
A topological space $X$ is said to be **Lindelof space** if every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover.

Note that satisfactions of these sub properties does not imply second countable 

### Locally Euclidean

A topological space $M$ is said to be **locally Euclidean** of dimension $n$ if every point of $M$ has a neighborhood in $M$ that is **homeomorphic** to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

> A topological space $M$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ if and only if either of the following properties holds:
> a) Every point of $M$ has a neighborhood **homeomorphic** to an **open ball** in $\mathbb{R}^n$
> b) Every point of $M$ has a neighborhood **homeomorphic** to  $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself.

Suppose $M$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$. if $U \subseteq M$ is an open subset that is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then $U$ is called a **coordinate domain**, and any homeomorphism $\psi$ from $U$ to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a **coordinate map**. 

The pair $(U,\psi)$ is called a **coordinate chart** of $M$

A coordinate domain that is homeomorphic to a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a **coordinate ball**.

If $p \in M$ and $U$ is a coordinate domain containing $p$, we say that $U$ is a **coordinate neighborhood** or **Euclidean neighborhood** of $p$.

### Topological Manifolds

**An n-dimensional topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally Euclidean of dimension n.**

- Every open subset of an n-manifold is an n-manifold
- (**Invariance of Dimension**): If $m \neq n$, a nonempty topological space cannot be both an $m$-manifold and an $n$-manifold.
-  A separable metric space that is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ is an $n$-manifold.

**Manifolds with Boundary:** 
Near the boundaries, spaces are modeled on the closed ndimensional upper half-space $\mathbb{H}^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ , defined by: $$\mathbb{H}^n = \{ (x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^n: x_{n} \geq 0\}$$
An **n-dimensional manifold with boundary** is a second countable Hausdorff space in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic **either to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or to an open subset of $\mathbb{H}^n$**

We use a special notation $\partial \mathbb{H}$ to be the boundary of the half-space, and $$\begin{align}
\partial \mathbb{H} = \{ (x_{1},\dots,x_{n}) \in\mathbb{R}^n : x_{n} =0\} \\
Int\mathbb{H} = \{ (x_{1},\dots,x_{n}) \in\mathbb{R}^n : x_{n} >0\} 
\end{align}$$
When $n=0$,we have $\mathbb{H}^0 = \mathbb{R}^0 = \{ 0 \}$, so $Int \mathbb{H}^0 = \mathbb{H}^0$ and $\partial \mathbb{H}^0 = \varnothing$

- $(U,\psi)$ is an **internal chart** if $\psi(U)$ is a open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$
- $(U,\psi)$ is a **boundary chart** if $\psi(U)$ is a open subset of $\mathbb{H}^n$ with $\partial \mathbb{H} \cap \psi(U) \neq \varnothing$

If $M$ is a $n$-manifold with boundary, a point $p \in M$ is called an

- **interior point** of $M$ if it is in the domain of an interior chart
- **boundary point** of $M$ if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that takes $p$ to $\partial \mathbb{H}^n$

The boundary $M$ (denoted by $\partial M$) is the collection of all boundary points, and the interior $M$ (denoted by $Int M$) is the set of all interior points.

> - If $M$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary, then $IntM$ is an open subset of $M$ , which is itself an n-dimensional manifold without boundary.
> - (Invariance of the Boundary). If $M$ is a manifold with boundary, then a point of $M$ cannot be both a boundary point and an interior point. Thus $\partial M$ and $Int M$ are disjoint subsets whose union is $M$.
> - If $M$ is a nonempty $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary, then $\partial M$ is closed in $M$ , and $M$ is an $n$-manifold if and only if $\partial M = \varnothing$
