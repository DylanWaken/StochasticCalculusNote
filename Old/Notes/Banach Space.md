A Banach space is a complete normed vector space (metric space), named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach.

- **Normed space**: A vector space with a norm, which is a function that assigns a non-negative real number (the "length" or "magnitude") to each vector in the space. The norm must satisfy three properties: 
   a. **Positive definiteness**: The norm of a vector is zero if and only if the vector is the zero vector. 
   b. **Homogeneity**: The norm of a scalar multiple of a vector is equal to the absolute value of the scalar times the norm of the vector.
   c. **Triangle inequality**: The norm of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their norms.

- **Complete**: A normed vector space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of vectors in the space  converges to a limit within the space. In other words, the space is "closed" with respect to the norm's topology, meaning there are no "holes" in the space.

A banach space is commonly represented as : $$(X,\lVert \cdot \rVert)$$
Which is a vector space with its norm: $$\lVert \cdot \rVert : X \to \mathbb{R}$$
